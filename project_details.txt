Project Name: Chatbot Bibliothèque Borj-El-Eilm

Description:
This is a Flask-based chatbot application for searching documents in the Borj-El-Eilm library. It uses advanced text similarity algorithms to find documents by code, reference, or name.

Main Technologies:
- Backend: Python Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Data Processing: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy
- Text Similarity: TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Jaro-Winkler, RapidFuzz
- Data Source: Excel file (BAI.xlsx)

Key Features:
- Intelligent document search by code, reference, or designation
- Multiple similarity algorithms for accurate results
- Real-time chat interface
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Statistics display (total items, stock)
- Responsive design

API Endpoints:
- / (GET): Main page with chat interface
- /api/search (POST): Search for documents
- /api/stats (GET): Get library statistics
- /api/suggestions (GET): Get search suggestions

Search Functionality:
- Exact search for codes and references
- Similarity-based search using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Fuzzy string matching with Jaro-Winkler and RapidFuzz
- Stock-based filtering
- Multi-field search combining code, reference, and designation

Frontend Features:
- Chat interface with bot and user messages
- Real-time search results display
- Voice input and output
- Quick search buttons
- Theme switching
- Responsive design for mobile devices

Data Processing:
- Loads Excel data with document information
- Preprocesses text for search optimization
- Creates multiple TF-IDF vectorizers for different search types
- Handles missing data and type conversions

This application provides an intelligent way to search through library documents using natural language queries and advanced text matching techniques.
